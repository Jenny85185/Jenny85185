## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hello! I'm Evgeniia Leonidova! 💫

I have been passionate about IT for a long time, developing in various fields — both as a Frontend Developer and as a QA Engineer (Test Specialist). I enjoy working with data, particularly in Excel, and I find it fascinating how data can help us make predictions and draw conclusions.

## 🛠 What I’m Working On:
- Learning data analysis and how data can be used for predictions.
- Exploring how data cleaning and processing work using Python.
- Diving deeper into working with databases and SQL for meaningful insights.
- Applying my QA background to ensure data integrity and correctness.

## 🌟 Currently Learning:
- Python for data cleaning, processing, and exploratory analysis.
- SQL for querying databases and extracting meaningful insights.
- Statistical methods to interpret and predict trends from data.

## 💡 Future Goals:
- Build data analysis projects that showcase insights through visualization and reporting.
- Strengthen my knowledge of database management and ETL processes.
- Continue developing my skills in both data analysis and quality assurance.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, preferably in the fields of data analytics, machine learning, or data visualization.

🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding more advanced statistical methods and how to apply them in real-world datasets.

💬 Ask me about data analysis, programming in Python, or how to effectively use Excel for data-driven decisions!

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through GitHub, or connect with me via LinkedIn ([my LinkedIn profile link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeniia-leonidova-85417a257/)).

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I hold a black belt in Karate and have a background in music education. I absolutely love cats, but I’m allergic to them! It speaks to my unyielding character and determination to pursue what I love, despite any obstacles – of course, within reason! 🥋🎶🐱
